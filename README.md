<h1>Cat Photo App</h1>
<h3>This Cat Photo App is a simple HTML project designed to demonstrate my foundational web development skills. The app is structured with semantic HTML elements, ensuring clean and organized code that is both accessible and easy to maintain.</h3>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<br>
<h4>Headings & Sections:</h4> The app uses <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> tags to create a clear content hierarchy, with content divided into meaningful sections using the <section> element.
<h4>Links & Images:</h4> It includes clickable links and images that direct users to an external cat photo gallery. Images are embedded with descriptive alt attributes for better accessibility.
<h4>Lists:</h4> The app showcases unordered (<ul>) and ordered (<ol>) lists to display things cats love and hate, respectively.
<h4>Figures:</h4> The use of the <figure> and <figcaption> elements provides context and captions for the images, enhancing the user experience.
<h4>Interactive Form:</h4> An interactive form is included for users to submit a cat photo URL. The form uses radio buttons, checkboxes, and text inputs within <fieldset> and <legend> elements to group related options and improve form usability.
<h4>Footer:</h4> A simple footer is added at the bottom of the page with a "No Copyright" notice.
<h5>This project is a demonstration of my ability to create a well-structured HTML document that is both functional and visually organized.</h5>
