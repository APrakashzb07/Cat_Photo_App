The Cat Photo App is a basic HTML project I created to demonstrate my web development skills. It features a well-structured layout with sections dedicated to displaying cat photos, lists of things cats love and hate, and an interactive form for users to submit their own cat photo URLs. The app utilizes semantic HTML elements like section, figure, and fieldset to ensure the code is organized and accessible. Through this project, I've showcased my ability to create a clean, functional, and user-friendly web page using pure HTML.
